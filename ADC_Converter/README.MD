# Overview
This project simulates the operation of a furnace that has a temperature sensor inside.
Depending on the temperature read, it is possible to have a different output:

* If the temperature is higher than 80 grades, the led red is ON
* Else, it's beteween 50 and 80 grades, the led yellow is ON
* Finally, the green led is ON showing that all it's fine.
